git-asamoal
===========

git-asamoal is a first attempt to place a structured repo on GitHub.

Over the years there are a lot of application utilities that I have developed which benefit from being released into the Open-Sourced Universe.

I look forward to learning and sharing what I can here.

One small step!

The few things I have in mind are
===========

- UML Models Library
   - UML Modeling Plugin for Network Engineering and IT Infrastructure
   - UML Modeling Plugin for Databases (Teradata)
   - UML Modeling Plugin for BMC Control-M Scheduler
